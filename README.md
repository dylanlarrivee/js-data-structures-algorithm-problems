# JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms

This is a collection of Javascript data structures, algorithms and leetcode problems that I am currenlty working on.

## Data Structures
Will be updated with notes soon.

## Algorithms
Will be updated with notes soon.

### Searching Algorithms

#### Linear Search
- Start at the begining or end of an array and search all the way through until you find it.
- For non sorted arrays this is how you will need to search.

Javascript has built in linear search methods:
    - indexOf()
	- includes()
	- find()
    - findIndex()

**Big O**
Best case: O(1)
	- Find it right away
Average: O(n)
Worst case: O(n)
    - Last or not found


## Leetcode Problems
Will be updated with notes soon.
